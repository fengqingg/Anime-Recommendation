# Anime Recommendation

As a relatively new fan of anime, I find myself overwhelmed with the sheer number of anime titles available to watch. With limited time on my hands, I need a way to narrow down my options and discover the best anime that align with my interests. To solve this problem, I embarked on a project to build an anime recommendation system.

In this notebook, I'll take you on my journey of creating a personalized anime recommendation system using Kaggle's anime recommendation dataset. Through various algorithms and techniques, I'll demonstrate how my model can suggest anime titles based on my viewing history and preferences.
